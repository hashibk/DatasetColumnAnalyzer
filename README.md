# Array Sorting by Even and Odd Elements

## Description
This C++ program sorts an input array such that all even elements appear first, followed by all odd elements. The relative order of the even and odd elements is maintained within their respective groups.

## Features:
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: Uses `new` to handle arrays dynamically.
- **Efficient Sorting**: Even elements are placed at the beginning and odd elements at the end while keeping their relative order.
- **User Input**: The user specifies the array size and elements for sorting.

## How It Works:
1. **Array Input**: The user provides the size and elements of the array.
2. **Sorting Process**: The program separates even and odd numbers and sorts them into a new array.
3. **Display Sorted Array**: The sorted array (even numbers followed by odd numbers) is printed.

## Usage:

### **Example Input:**
Enter size of array= 5 Enter array element= 4 Enter array element= 3 Enter array element= 7 Enter array element= 2 Enter array element= 1


### **Example Output:**
4 2 3 7 1
