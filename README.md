# Letter Frequency Counter  

## Overview  
This program calculates the frequency of each letter (both uppercase and lowercase) in a given sentence. It dynamically allocates memory for an array that tracks the count of each letter in the alphabet (a-z), and displays the frequency of only the letters that appear in the sentence.  

## Features  
✅ **Letter Frequency Calculation:** Tracks and counts the frequency of each letter in a given string.  
✅ **Case Insensitivity:** The program counts both lowercase and uppercase letters equivalently.  
✅ **Dynamic Memory Allocation:** Uses dynamic memory allocation for storing letter counts.  
✅ **Display:** Outputs the frequency of each letter that appears in the string.
