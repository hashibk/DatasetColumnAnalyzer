# Merge Even-Odd Arrays

## Description
This C++ program merges two arrays by arranging all even numbers in the beginning and odd numbers at the end. It handles dynamic memory allocation and ensures the relative order of the even and odd numbers is maintained from both input arrays.

## Features:
- **Merging**: Merges two input arrays into one.
- **Even-Odd Sorting**: Even numbers appear first, followed by odd numbers.
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: Memory for the merged array is dynamically allocated.
- **Order Preservation**: The relative order of even and odd numbers from both input arrays is maintained.

## How It Works:
1. **Array Input**: The user provides two arrays with elements.
2. **Merging Process**: The program combines the two arrays by first placing all even numbers from both arrays and then placing the odd numbers in reverse order.
3. **Display Result**: The merged array is printed with even numbers first followed by odd numbers.

## Usage:

### **Example Input:**
Enter size of first array= 3 Enter size of second array= 3 Enter array element of first array= 2 Enter array element of first array= 1 Enter array element of first array= 4 Enter array element of second array= 3 Enter array element of second array= 6 Enter array element of second array= 5


### **Example Output:**
2 4 6 3 1 5
