# Dynamic Matrix Allocation and Display  

## Overview  
This program dynamically allocates memory for a matrix based on user input for rows and columns, initializes all elements to zero, displays the matrix, and then deallocates the memory used.  

## Features  
✅ **Dynamic Memory Allocation:** Memory for the matrix is allocated at runtime using `new`.  
✅ **Matrix Initialization:** The matrix is initialized with zeros using a loop.  
✅ **Display:** The program displays the matrix in a formatted grid.  
✅ **Memory Deallocation:** Memory is properly deallocated to prevent memory leaks.
