# String Concatenation Program  

## Overview  
This program demonstrates **manual string manipulation** using **character arrays** in C++. It defines a function `concate()` that:  
- Takes two character arrays (C-style strings) and their sizes as input.  
- Concatenates them into a dynamically allocated third array, adding a **space** between them.  
- Prints the concatenated result.  

## Features  
- Uses **manual memory management** with `new` to allocate space for the concatenated string.  
- Demonstrates **basic string manipulation** without using the C++ `string` class.  
- Uses **pointer-based array handling**.
